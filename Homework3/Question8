8. What is the bottleneck in the following system setup, the CPU, memory bus, or the disk set?
 The user program continuously performs reads of 64KB blocks, and requires 2 million
cycles to process each block.
 The clock rate is 3GHz.
 The maximum sustained transfer rate of the memory bus is 640MB/sec. 
 The operating system requires 1 million cycles of overhead for each I/O operation.
 The read/write bandwidth of the disk controller and the disk drives is 64MB/sec, disk
average seek (plus rotational) latency is 9ms.
 There are 5 disks attached to the bus each with its own controller. (Assume that each disk
can be controlled independently and ignore disk conflicts.) 
We have 3 operations, processing the block in the CPU, loading the block from memory into the cache, and loading the block from hard disk into memory
For the block processing in the CPU we will take 2 Million cycles to process, with a 3GHz clock speed(3*10^9 cycles/second), which will take us (2*10^6)/(3*10^9) = 0.666mS to perform.
For transferring the block from memory to the CPU we will have 1 Million cycles of I/O overhead, and then have to transfer 64KB at 640 MB/s.
So, we have (64*10^3)/(640*10^6) + (1*10^6)/(3*10^9) = 0.433mS
For transferring the block from hard disk to memory, we will have 1 Million cycles of I/O latency, then have a 9mS seek time, then a transfer of 64KB at 64MB/s.
So, we have (64*10^3)/(64*10^6) + 9mS + (1*10^6)/(3*10^9)= 10.3mS
Thus, we see that the hard disk is the bottleneck of the system.
