Assume that a sensor outputs an analog signal with a range of 0V and 4V (i.e., reference voltage =
4V). A linear A/D converter then converts the analog signal into a digital signal. The transfer function
is shifted to the left Â½ LSB to reduce quantization error.
(a) Identify the smallest detectable change in voltage (that is, no matter what the original voltage is,
the change can always be detected) if the ADC uses (1) 4-bits of resolution; (2) 7-bits of
resolution.
(b) For an input voltage of 3.14V, identify the quantization error if the ADC uses (1) 4-bits of
resolution; (2) 7-bits of resolution.

A)1) Assuming we have a 4 bit resolution, we can calculate the smallest detectable change from 4V/2^4, which is 4V/16 = 0.25V
A)2)Assuming we have a 7 bit resolution, we  can calculate the smallest detectable change from 4V/2^7, which is 4V/128 = 0.03125V
B)1)With a 4 bit resolution, we find a digital value for 2.718 of (2.718/0.25) rounded, which is (10.872) rounded up to 11. Then, our error is 11-10.872 * 0.25= 0.032Volts.
B)2)With a 7 bit resolution, we find a digital value for 2.718 of (2.718/0.03125) rounded, which is (86.976) rounded up to 87. Then, the quantization error is 0.024 * 0.03125 = 0.00075Volts.
