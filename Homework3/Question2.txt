Assume that a sensor outputs an analog signal with a range of 0V and 4V (i.e., reference voltage =
4V). A linear A/D converter then converts the analog signal into a digital signal. The transfer function
is shifted to the left Â½ LSB to reduce quantization error.
(a) Identify the smallest detectable change in voltage (that is, no matter what the original voltage is,
the change can always be detected) if the ADC uses (1) 4-bits of resolution; (2) 7-bits of
resolution.
(b) For an input voltage of 3.14V, identify the quantization error if the ADC uses (1) 4-bits of
resolution; (2) 7-bits of resolution.
(c) Assume the A/D converter supplies samples at 40 kHz. When a sample arrives, an interrupt
handler will be invoked to process the sample and feed the result to the application. The ADC
ISR executes 150 instructions to process each sample for the application. The processor is
40MHz, and executes one instruction per cycle. Assuming the processor is running only the
application and interrupt handler, how many application instructions can be executed between
two consecutive interrupts?
A)1) Assuming we have a 4 bit resolution, we can calculate the smallest detectable change from 4V/2^4, which is 4V/16 = 0.25V
A)2)Assuming we have a 7 bit resolution, we  can calculate the smallest detectable change from 4V/2^7, which is 4V/128 = 0.03125V
B)1)With a 4 bit resolution, we find a digital value for 3.14 of (3.14/0.25) rounded, which is (12.56) rounded up to 13. Then, our error is 13-12.55 * 0.25= 0.11Volts.
B)2)With a 7 bit resolution, we find a digital value for 3.14 of (3.14/0.03125) rounded, which is (100.48) rounded down to 100. Then, the quantization error is 0.48 * 0.03125 = 0.015Volts.
C)1)Given a frequency of 40kHz, and a processor frequency of 40MHz, we know know the ISR is occuring 1000 times per second from 40MHz/40KHz = 1000. Thus, between every ISR, 1000 instructions occur on the CPU. Given that an ISR requires 150 instructions for execution, then we know that (1000-150)=850 instructions can occur in the application between consecutive interrupts
