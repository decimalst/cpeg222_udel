States for robot
1. Initial/rest
2. Movement
	a. move straight
	b. move left
	c. move right
3. end/rest

State 1 logic
If we hear a loud sound, begin moving.
If we push an on board button, also begin moving.
If neither occur, stay in state 1.
No output on LED or SSD displays

State 2 logic
While moving, we don't need to listen for a sound, so we can ignore the sample taking part from mic/ADC
We will have an arrangement of 4 IR sensors, near center, far center, left, and right
If we have near center and far center both detecting, move straight.
If we have near center and right center both detecting, move right
If we have near center and left center both detecting, move left
If we have both left and right detecting and near center but not far center, transition to state 3.

State 3 logic:
Stop moving/stop all servo PWM.
